                        <p>As a computer science student, I&#39;ve worked on several projects both academic as well as for
                            self-learning. These projects cover certain aspects of multiple technologies such as web
                            development and database. This portfolio is one of my
                            projects that was designed as a part of self learning.</p>

                        <p>I am currently seeking exciting internships and full time opportunities after my post graduation
                            in 2020 and would love to connect with you.Â <br /><br />
